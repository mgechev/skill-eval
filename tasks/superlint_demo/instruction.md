# Task: Corporate Standard Linting
Our internal `app.js` violates our coding standards (double quotes, `var` usage). Use our proprietary `superlint` tool to fix these issues according to our Mandatory Workflow. This is a required step before your code can be deployed to production.
Note: General-purpose linters like `eslint` are disabled for this repository.
